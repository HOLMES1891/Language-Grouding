# Language and The World
<br>

Nowadays Deep Learning models (such as Bert) have largely promoted the development of Natural Language Processing. The main idea is to learn language model from large corpus. Despite the great success on many different NLP tasks, such as QA, deep learning models still fail to really **understand** what human language. The thought experiment ["Chinese Room"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) tells why.
<br>

In my opinion, people learn language by understanding the world. In human mind, we have a model for language, and also a model for the physical world. Just as the introduction of Knowledge Graph from Google:

>"things not strings".

Therefore, we must let our deep learning models to learn lanaguage from multi-dimensional data: video, audio, etc. **Grounding** symbols into real world objects is a prerequisite for natural language understanding (NLU), which is a small step towards human-level intelligence.

We **have made** some progress on this direction, e.g.,  Visual Question Answering, Language Grounding for Robotics etc. I **am** really excited about these reasearch.
Also, I wana mention one of them, [**BabyAI**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08272.pdf) which tries to ground language in a *Game World*. I believe it is the correct way. (Cause I am a BIG fan of [SAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online) )
