Here is a reading list for Language Grounding and some related topics. Although these works have not draw much attention yet, I believe they are important and indispensable for AGI.

1. [**Language Grounding to Vision and Control**](https://katefvision.github.io/LanguageGrounding/)
2. [**Modularity of Mind**](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modularity-mind/#WhatMentModu) & [**Is the mind really modular?**](http://www.subcortex.com/PrinzModularity.pdf)
